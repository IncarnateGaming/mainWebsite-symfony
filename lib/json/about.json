		"motto": "Our Imagination is Our Only Limitation",
		"intro": "We have long sought a game where we are limited only by our imagination; a place where we can outsmart the game. Yet that game evolves and continues to challenge us. A place where we can play with friends and meet new ones. Where we learn each others tactics and form teams that can take on heights previously unimagined... And now that game is a reality."

			"bio": "Philip grew up as an introvert. It was not until college that he encountered Table Top Role Playing games. When he did, he discovered a forger's fire that teaches social skills at a higher level than any of the workshops or conferences he had attended. He decided to develop a system to allow anyone to become an excellent Game Master to allow anyone to perfect the social skills that our society needs to function well."
